I am a Senior Lecturer (Associate Professor) in the Department of Computing & Mathematics at the Manchester Metropolitan University (also affiliated with the Data Science and AI Theme groups). I do research on misinformation, AI and Large language Models. My research group investigates questions regarding robust models that work across many domains and languages, while requiring fewer labels, and making efficient use of computational resources. I am also interested in data-driven dialogue agents that safely and naturally converse on any topic.

I am recruiting multiple Ph.D. students this year. You can find information about our Ph.D. program here. For current Manchester Metropolitan University students interested in research: please email me a copy of your resume and a summary of what you are hoping to achieve by getting involved in research.
There is a postdoc position available in my group. Please contact me directly, if interested.

What else do you need?
